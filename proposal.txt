Proposal for a Simple Card Game: "High Card"

**Objective:**
The objective of the game is to win all the cards in the deck by comparing the values of the cards drawn.

**Game Overview:**
"High Card" is a simple card game where two players compete to collect all the cards in the deck. Each player starts with half of the deck, and they take turns drawing the top card from their own deck and comparing its value to the opponent's drawn card. The player with the higher value card wins both cards and adds them to the bottom of their own deck. The game continues until one player has collected all the cards.

**Functionalities:**
1. **Game Setup**: 
   - Initialize a full deck of cards (52 cards).
   - Shuffle the deck and split it equally between the two players.

2. **Card Comparison**: 
   - Players take turns drawing the top card from their deck.
   - Compare the value of the drawn cards (e.g., Ace < 2 < 3 < ... < 10 < Jack < Queen < King).
   - The player with the higher value card wins both cards and adds them to the bottom of their deck.

3. **Winning Condition**:
   - The game ends when one player has collected all the cards.
   - Display a message declaring the winner.

4. **Additional Functionalities**:
   - **Visual Representation**: Design a user interface to display the cards drawn by each player and the cards remaining in their decks.
   - **Scorekeeping**: Keep track of the number of rounds won by each player.
   - **Restart Game**: Allow players to restart the game after one player wins.
   - **Customization**: Provide options to customize the game, such as changing the number of players or altering the rules.

**Technologies:**
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for game logic and user interface)
- **Backend**: Not required for this simple single-player or local multiplayer game.
- **Libraries/Frameworks**: Consider using libraries like jQuery for DOM manipulation or Bootstrap for styling to expedite development.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Design the user interface, including card visuals and player decks.
2. Implement the game logic for shuffling the deck, drawing cards, comparing card values, and determining the winner.
3. Integrate user interactions such as clicking to draw cards and displaying game outcomes.
4. Test the game thoroughly to ensure functionality and user experience.
5. Deploy the game on a web platform for players to access and enjoy.

**Future Enhancements:**
- **Multiplayer Mode**: Implement online multiplayer functionality to allow players to compete against each other remotely.
- **AI Opponent**: Develop an AI opponent for single-player mode to play against.
- **Animations**: Add animations for card movements and game actions to enhance the visual appeal.
- **Sound Effects**: Include sound effects for card shuffling, drawing, and winning rounds to make the game more immersive.
- **Leaderboards**: Implement a leaderboard system to track high scores or winning streaks.
- **Themes**: Allow players to choose different themes or card designs for a personalized experience.
